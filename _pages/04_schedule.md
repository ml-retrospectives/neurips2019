### Description of the “Meetup-style” session at the workshop:

A large part of the advantage from hosting a workshop is to be able to leverage a diversity of expertise from the extended ML community and we believe that there is a way to do so that is very interactive and engaging via the proposed “meetup-style” session in the schedule.  We believe there is a lot to be gained from getting feedback from a diversity of ML researchers and practitioners. With that in mind, this session is meant to be a facilitated discussion group that will bring together different stakeholders that can benefit from ML retrospectives. The aim of the session is to organically through discussion, around a prior set of questions, surface potential best practices and ways to improve the effectiveness and usefulness of ML retrospectives. We believe that this will be the genesis for a great community driven standard for improving the quality and dissemination of the research work that we all do. This session will be co-led by Abhishek Gupta, who has organized over 40 similar sessions through the Montreal AI Ethics Institute. 

Proposed schedule for the one hour meetup-style session:

* 0:00-0:05 Introduction, format and how the session will work 
* 0:05-0:10 Break out into small groups 
* 0:10-0:40 Facilitated group discussion around a set of motivating questions
* 0:40-0:55 Short summaries from some volunteer groups
* 0:55-1:00 Wrap-up
